Basic Information
------
This repo is an advancement on the previous Maze Generation repo. A new function, MazeSolver, is incorporated to find the shortest path from a given start location and a goal location. The user can choose to display a GUI or not by commenting out a line in the example file. Regardless, the code will print the shortest path using the AStar algorithm  to the command line. An example code is provided for the user. 

maze_solver_script.py Info
------
This python script utilizes a class to parse the inputs goal row, goal column, start row, start column, and finally the input file. It outputs the shortest path to the command line. The default values for the goal row and coloumns are 1. Comment out line 31 if you wish to disable the GUI.

Example 1 Usage â€“ maze_solver_example_1.py
------
This example is very similar to example 1. Comment out line 35 if you do not wish to see the GUI.
